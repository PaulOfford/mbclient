        <h1>User Guide</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Blogging is a popular way to share information with Internet users by posting short articles in an
            <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  In an emergency situation, blogging could provide a way to disseminate critical
            information if it weren't for the fact that Internet access is often unavailable is such situations.</p>
        <p>The use of radio for emergency communications is well understood and, of course, is always available.
            JS8 is a radio data mode that works in a wide range of conditions.  With all the above in mind, let's
            move onto the concept of microblogging.</p>
        <p><img src="images/MbloggingOverview.jpg" width="640" /></p>
        <p>A microblog is a blog that contains small concise posts that are delivered to amateur radio operators
            via JS8.  Although it may take 3 minutes for JS8 to deliver a microblog
            post, it doesn't rely on the Internet and is reliable in adverse conditions.</p>
        <p><img src="images/configuration.jpg" width="640" /></p>
        <p>A microblog server is hosted on an amateur radio operator's computer and uses the JS8Call application
            to provide the JS8 transport mechanism.  A microblog client sends requests to the mbserver which
            responds with the requested information.</p>
        <h2>Microblog Post File</h2>
        <p>A microblog post is stored as a simple text file in the server computer.  The content of the text file
            will look something like this:</p>
        <p style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 8px;">
            <code>
                Three of the four new astronauts on February's planned launch of the SpaceX Crew-6 mission to the
                International Space Station (ISS) are amateur radio operators.<br/>
                <br/>
                Pilot Warren "Woody" Hoburg, KB3HTZ; Commander Stephen Bowen, KI5BKB, and Mission Specialist
                Sultan Al Neyadi, KI5VTV, will join Mission Specialist Andrey Fedyaev on board the SpaceX Dragon
                spacecraft, Endeavour.

        <p>Although we can create a post file with any content we wish, there are a few points to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each post should be short and concise as long posts will take an unacceptable time to transmit</li>
            <li>Although we can use mixed case in the file, the post is sent to the client in upper case</li>
            <li>Only characters in the JS8 character set are acceptable
                <ul><li>unfortunately that means no support for languages such as Arabic or Japanese</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The format of the file name is important.  The file name must contain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post ID - a unique number within this particular blog</li>
            <li>Date - the date of the post in ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd)</li>
            <li>Title - a headline title for the post</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's a directory listing for the sample posts that are included in the mbserver installation package:</p>

        <p>As you can see, the Post ID is the first element of the file name (e.g. 0026).  The post ID can have any
            number of leading zeros (or none at all).  The advantage of using a consistent number of Post ID digits
            is that when we list the directory, we can order it by Post ID.</p>
        <p>Next comes the Date of the post.  This should be the date associated with the information, rather
            than the date the post was created.  Notice how I created post 0028 on February 4th (my computer locale
            displays dates in dd/mm/yyy format) but the Post Date shows as 2023-01-26.  That's because the source
            ARRL article was dated January 26th.  Similarly, I might later edit post 0028 to correct a typo and,
            although the file system Modified Date will change, the Post Date will remain 2023-01-26.</p>
        <p>Finally we have the title of the post.</p>
        <p>The challenge for an operator running a server is to keep the post title and content as concise as
            possible to minimise transmission time.</p>
        <h2>MbClient Functionality</h2>
        <p>The MbClient app has the following capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Listing</b> - list the posts of a blog providing Post ID and Post Title</li>
            <li><b>Extended Listing</b> - list the posts of a blog providing Post ID, Post Date and Post Title</li>
            <li><b>Get</b> - retrieve the contents of a post from the server and display it</li>
            <li><b>Latest Posts</b> - maintain and display a list of the most recent posts sent by a microblog server
                to any users</li>
            <li><b>Blog List</b> - maintain a list of available blogs by monitoring @MB Announcement messages*</li>
            <li><b>Caching</b> - save any retrieved listings or posts in a database for instant display in the future</li>
            <li><b>Promiscuous Caching</b> - save listings and posts sent to other users for instant display in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 80%">* @MB Announcement - Each microblog server periodically sends to the JS8 group @MB
            an announcement message containing the blog name, latest Post ID and latest Post Date</p>
        <h2>Interface Layout</h2>
        <p><img src="images/InterfaceLayout.jpg" width="640" /></p>
        <p>The user interface for the MbClient has five areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Header</b> - this area displays the rig frequency setting, the JS8Call offset, the client call sign,
                the GMT (UTC) date and time, and a Scan button</li>
            <li><b>Latest Posts</b> - this area displays the latest post details from any blog server to any user, and is
                gathered by monitoring JS8 messages</li>
            <li><b>QSO Box</b> - this area displays retreived listings and posts, together with timstamped progress messages
                that indicate what the app is doing at a point in time</li>
            <li><b>Command Line Interface</b> - this area displays the name of the blog you are currently interacting with
                and provides a dialogue box for you to enter commands</li>
            <li><b>Blog List</b> - this area lists the blogs that have been seen and should be available to you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's look at three typical ways you would use this interface.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 1 - List the latest posts available from a blog</h3>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/SelectM0PXO.jpg" width="320" /></p>
        <p>We start by clicking on a blog in the Blog List.  Above we have chosen the M0PXO blog.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/ListingCommand.jpg" width="120" /></p>
        <p>Next we enter the L command in the Command Line Interface (CLI) box and hit Enter.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/ListingProgress.jpg" width="480" /></p>
        <p>The command is echoed in the QSO Box, and we see a progress message that shows that the app
            has asked the server for a list of the most recent posts.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/ListingDisplayed.jpg" width="480" /></p>
        <p>The listing is retrieved from the microblog server and displayed in the QSO Box.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 2 - View a particular post</h3>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/GetCommand.jpg" width="160" /></p>
        <p>With the M0PXO blog still selected, we enter the G command in the CLI box and hit Enter.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/GetProgress.jpg" width="480" /></p>
        <p>The command is echoed in the QSO Box, and we see a progress message that shows that the app
            has asked the server for the post content.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/GetDisplayed.jpg" width="480" /></p>
        <p>The post content is retrieved from the server and displayed in the QSO Box.</p>

        <h3>Scenario 3 - Get a Latest Post</h3>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/ClickLatestPost.jpg" width="280" /></p>
        <p>Click on a post in the Latest Posts area.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/LatestPostProgress.jpg" width="480" /></p>
        <p>A GET (G) command appears in the QSO Box, and the correct blog is selected.  This may also cause the
            rig frequency in the Header area to change if the Latest Post was heard on another frequency.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/LatestDisplayed.jpg" width="480" /></p>
        <p>The post content is retrieved from the server and displayed in the QSO Box.</p>
