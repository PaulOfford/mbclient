        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>This microblog client (mbclient) is written in Python so that it can be run on a broad range
            of platforms.  The GUI is based on the tkinter library, which is portable across platforms.
            Data is stored in a SQLite database, which comes bundled with Python and, again,
            chosen for its wide platform support.  The database is used to provide persistence, including
            the saving of settings.</p>
        <p>Python persistent object facilities (like <i>pickle</i>) were considered, but these wouldn't meet
            all the data needs and are more complex to maintain.</p>
        <p>mbclient comprises two components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Front-end - the GUI and code relating to presentation</li>
            <li>Back-end - code that deals with communication and the main logic of the program</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these components runs in its own Python thread.  Python multithreading does not equate
            to OS multithreading, i.e. it does not use multiple cores.  However, the client will spend a
            lot of time waiting for UI events and network IO (API calls to JS8Call) and so it should meet
            our needs.  Python multiprocessing could be considered at a later stage, if neccessary.
            Communication between the front-end and back-end is via a table in the SQLite database which
            is used as a mailbox-style messaging mechanism.</p>
