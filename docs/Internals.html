        <h1>Internals</h1>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>This microblog client (mbclient) is written in Python so that it can be run on a broad range
            of platforms.  The GUI is based on the tkinter library, which is portable across platforms.
            Data is stored in a SQLite database, which comes bundled with Python and, again,
            chosen for its wide platform support.  The database is used to provide persistence, including
            the saving of settings.</p>
        <p>Python persistent object facilities (like <i>pickle</i>) were considered, but these wouldn't meet
            all the data needs and are more complex to maintain.</p>
        <p><img src="images/components.jpg" width="640" /></p>
        <p>mbclient comprises three components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frontend - the GUI and code relating to presentation</li>
            <li>Backend - code that provides the main logic of the program</li>
            <li>JS8 Driver - code that handles the communication with JS8Call</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these components runs in its own Python thread.  Python multithreading does not equate
            to OS multithreading, i.e. it does not use multiple cores.  However, the client will spend a
            lot of time waiting for UI events and network IO (API calls to JS8Call) and so it should meet
            our needs.  Python multiprocessing could be considered at a later stage, if necessary.</p>
        <h2>Messaging</h2>
        <p>Frontend-to-backend and backend-to-comms messages are objects with getter and setter methods.  The messages
            are defined in message_q.py. The messages are placed on Python queues (queue.Queue) and these are
            instantiated in the MbClient class.</p>
        <h3>GUI Frontend-to-Backend Messages</h3>
        <p>Communication between the frontend and backend is via message objects placed on one of two Python FIFO
            Queues; f2b_q for frontend to backend messaging, and b2f_q for backend to frontend.  The sending code
            puts a new messages on the queue, and the receiving code gets the message from the queue.  There are three
            types of message:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request (req) - a command from the frontend to the backend</li>
            <li>Response (rsp) - the response from the backend to an earlier command</li>
            <li>Notification (ntf) - an async message from the backend to the frontend indicating some
                change of state, e.g. the operator tunes the radio to another frequency</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an example of a matching request and response:</p>
        <p>
            <code>
            ts = 1676976154.154798,
            req_ts = 0.0,
            cli_input = '',
            cmd = 'S',
            blog = 'NEWSEN',
            station = 'K7GHI',
            frequency = 14078000,
            post_id = 0,
            post_date = 0,
            op = '',
            param = '',
            rc = 0
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
            ts = 1676976154.1837683,
            req_ts = 1676976154.154798,
            cli_input = '',
            cmd = 'S',
            blog = 'NEWSEN',
            station = 'K7GHI',
            frequency = 14078000,
            post_id = 0,
            post_date = 0,
            op = '',
            param = '',
            rc = 0
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>In this example, the frontend is sending a request to the backend to change the currently selected blog in the blog list.
            Notice how the req_ts value matches the ts value of the request.  A non-zero Response Code (rc) would indicate an error
            has occurred in the backend, e.g. if we try to set the selected blog to a blog that doesn't exist in the list.</p>
        <p>There is no synchronisation between requests and responses.  In theory, the backend may
            process multiple requests before a response is sent, and the responses are not guaranteed to be in
            an order that matches the requests.  There is, however, a correlation mechanism to match responses
            to earlier requests.  Every message is timestamped.  A response contains a value req_ts which gives
            the timestamp of the matching request message.</p>
        <p>Although we have the message queues, the majority of backend to frontend data is passed via the database.
            The job of the frontend is to present the data in the database.  The frontend never makes changes to
            the database.  When the frontend requires a change that affects the database, such as a change of
            selected blog:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frontend sends a message to the backend with the new values</li>
            <li>Backend makes the database changes needed to reflect the new values</li>
            <li>Backend sets the current Epoch time in the appropriate xxxx_updated field</li>
            <li>The backend sends a Notify message to the frontend to indicate it should reload a GUI area</li>
            <li>The frontend sees the Notify and checks for any xxxx_updated fields</li>
            <li>Frontend reloads the area of the GUI as per the xxxx_updated field</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The frontend checks for messages from the backend on the b2f_q queue by trying a non-blocking get for
            a message every 200ms.  If the queue is empty, the get causes a queue.Empty exception, which is
            handled and essentially ignored.  The method that does this work is process_updates() in the MbClient
            class.  The process_updates() method is called via the tkinter callback mechanism; search the code
            for <code>root.after(200, self.process_updates)</code></p>
        <h3>Backend-to-Comms Messages</h3>
        <p>Similar objects are used for requests and responses flowing between the backend and the comms driver.
            Communication between the backend and comms driver is via message objects placed on one of two Python
            FIFO Queues; comms_tx_q for backend to comms messaging, and comms_rx_q for comms to backend.</p>
        <h2>Database</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>We use a SQLite database at the core of the application.  The database has four tables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>qso - the table used to contain listings, blogs and progress messages
            <ul><li>used to populate the QSO and New Posts boxes</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>blogs - a table that contains details of blogs identified
            <ul><li>used to populate the Blog List box</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>settings - holds settings defined using the Settings window (File -> Settings)</li>
            <li>status - holds context information, such as current selected blog, and a range of timestamps
                used to indicate data change</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As far as the application code is concerned, all database access is made using the DbTable class
            in db_table.py.</p>
        <h3>Database Installation</h3>
        <p>sqlite3 is a standard module of Python 3 and so there is no need to install additional packages.</p>
        <p>The location of the database is defined in the file db_root.py.  This file needs to be edited to
            suit each user's preference.  Having the user edit a file like this is not ideal; it would be
            good to add an appropriate startup window.</p>
        <p>The database is created by the script db_setup.py.  This script also populates the database with
            sample data and default settings.  The sample data will eventually age out of the QSO and Blog List.
            If desired, we can supress the sample data by commenting out the code that inserts it into the database,
            or by using the SQLite command line tool and delete the entries in the qso and blogs tables.</p>
        <p>
            <code>sqlite> DELETE FROM blogs;</code><br/>
            <code>sqlite> DELETE FROM qso;</code>
        </p>
